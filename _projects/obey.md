2015 (Masters)

## Description 

This was a long time ago... Can I even still code in Scala?

Here is the gist of it:

```
Obey is a linter tool for Scala.
Obey enables to define rules, based on scala.meta trees and the TQL library, corresponding to code health requirements.
A rule can generate warnings and/or propose to correct the source code automatically.
```

The code is obviously completely out-of-date and was just a prototype, but I think it came before scala's default linter...
Another usage for this project was to integrate it directly in CI to update library APIs without developer's intervention, apply coding-style rules etc.
