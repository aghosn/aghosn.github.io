## ELF 64 parser in C

---

Writing code to parse an ELF binary seems to be something that I have to do at least once every two years.
As part of my `C-Stem` initiative, I decided to package my C implementation into a library.

The library supports symbol lookups (but does not parse relocations... yet).

I might be able to get my hands on my Go and Rust implementations and publish them here as well.
