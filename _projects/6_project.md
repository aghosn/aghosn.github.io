## Description 

Back during my master at EPFL, I worked on a few plugins for the Scala compiler.
This is one of them.

I barely remember the details of it but apparently:

```
The AST Persistence Project aims to store ASTs in a compressed way along with the Byte Code in order to allow their interpretation at compile time.
The main use of such tool is for Macro expansion, in order to avoid Macros to be precompiled.

The project will be done as an external compiler plugin.

```

Don't judge me too harshly, this was a long time ago...
