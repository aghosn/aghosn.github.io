## Operating System Design & Implementation 15-410
---

I did my third year of undergraduate studies at CMU and took the famous OS class there.

This class explains my love-hate relationship with systems, as well as why I took a break to work on higher-level programming languages and compilers for a while.

The class project was to implement a x86 UNIX-like operating system, including drivers, virtual memory, processes/threads, which I did alone.

We were not allowed to publish the code, but <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/'>here</a> is the website for the class.
