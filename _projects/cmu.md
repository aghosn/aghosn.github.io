## Description

I did my third year of undergrad' at CMU and was crazy enough to take the OS class and do the project alone.

This class explains my love-hate relationship with systems, as well as why I took a break to work on higher-level programming languages and compilers for while.

The class project was to implement an x86 UNIX-like operating system, including drivers, virtual memory, processes/threads.

We were not allowed to publish the code, but <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/'>here</a> is the website for the class.
