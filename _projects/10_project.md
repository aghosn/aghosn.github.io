## Description

I did my third year of undergrad' at CMU and was crazy enough to take the OS class there (and do the project alone ((I passed))).

The class project was to implement an x86 UNIX-like operating system, including drivers, virtual memory, processes/threads.

<a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/'>Here</a> is the website for the class.
