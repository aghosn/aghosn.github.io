Welcome to my personal page!

I am Adrien, a Post Doc researcher at Microsoft Cambridge.
My areas of interest are: Virtualization, Confidential Computing, Systems, Security, & Compilers.

My current work revolves around the implementation of a novel security monitor, written in Rust, to support compartmentalization and confidential computing on legacy commodity hardware (x86 and RISC-V).

Prior to joining Microsoft, I obtained a PhD at EPFL (Switzerland), with Prof. Edouard Bugnion, Prof. James R. Larus, and Prof. Mathias Payer.
My research lied at the intersection between programming languages, systems, and security.
